    "IntroText": "**AYA (stands for Açık Yazılım Ağı, meaning Open Source Network in Turkish)** is an initiative that enables volunteers who produce quality IT solutions with the motivation of creating social benefit to come together and realize projects.\n\nFrom the very beginning, people formed the building blocks of AYA. People who knew each other and were involved in IT and technology created a vast community and were able to realize projects when they were most needed. These projects became IT solutions with open source licenses, open to everyone's use and oversight, primarily official institutions and civil society organizations.\n\nWhile people who produce in the IT and technology ecosystem play such a critical role, we created the aya.is platform you are currently on, thinking that there was [a need for a platform](/en/stories/20241203-developer-platformu-eksikligi) to better know the people in this ecosystem, highlight their work, and get to know them.\n\nYou can start exploring the platform from the [Elements](/en/elements), [Products](/en/products), [Content](/en/content) and [Articles](/en/stories) sections!"
