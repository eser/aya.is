AYA is an open-source community platform that connects developers and organizations building technology for social good.

Born from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake relief effort, AYA (Açık Yazılım Ağı — Open Source Network) grew out of a grassroots movement where over 24,000 volunteers came together to build tools that saved lives. Today it serves as a hub for the open-source community, bringing together people who believe technology should be accessible, inclusive, and purpose-driven.
