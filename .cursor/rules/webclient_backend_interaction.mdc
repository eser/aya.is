# Backend Interaction Workflow

This document outlines the standard procedure for interacting with backend services, specifically tailored for generative AI and code agents.

## Centralized Backend Module

The primary mechanism for backend communication is through a centralized module located at `src/shared/modules/backend/backend.ts`.

**Path:** `[src/shared/modules/backend/backend.ts](mdc:src/shared/modules/backend/backend.ts)`

## How to Use

1.  **Import the `backend` Object:**
    React Server Components, or any other server-side modules needing backend data, should import the `backend` object from this central file.
    ```typescript
    import { backend } from "@/shared/modules/backend/backend.ts";
    ```

2.  **Access API Methods:**
    The `backend` object exports various methods, each corresponding to a specific backend API endpoint or data-fetching operation. These methods are clearly named and provide type safety for parameters and return values.
    ```typescript
    // Example: Fetching a user profile
    type ProfileProps = {
      profileId: string;
    };

    async function UserProfile(props: ProfileProps) {
      const profile = await backend.getProfile("en", props.profileId);
      // ... render profile
    }

    // Example: Fetching stories by an author
    type StoriesProps = {
      authorProfileId: string;
    };

    async function Stories(props: StoriesProps) {
      const stories = await backend.getProfileStories("en", props.authorProfileId);
      // ... render stories
    }
    ```

## Benefits for AI Agents

-   **Single Source of Truth:** Agents should treat `backend.ts` as the definitive source for discovering and utilizing available backend functionalities. There's no need to scan other directories or guess API function locations.
-   **Clear Contract:** Each method on the `backend` object represents a well-defined contract with the backend, including expected inputs and outputs, enforced by TypeScript.
-   **Simplified Interaction:** This pattern simplifies the task for AI agents by providing a consistent and predictable way to make backend calls.
-   **Abstraction:** The internal structure of how these backend functions are organized (e.g., within `profiles/` or `stories/` sub-folders) is abstracted away, allowing agents to focus on the available operations.

**Guidance for Agents:**
When tasked with implementing features that require backend data, always refer to the methods exported by `src/shared/modules/backend/backend.ts`. Assume that any necessary backend interaction is exposed through this central `backend` object.

### Type Imports

While backend *functions* must be accessed via the central `backend` object, importing TypeScript *types* directly from backend submodules (e.g., `import type { MyType } from '@/shared/modules/backend/profiles/types';`) is permissible for type safety, especially when these types define the structure of data returned by the backend functions or are used as parameters by those functions.
